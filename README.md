🌌 VDSemiX - 3D Quantum Space Research Logo 🚀
Welcome to the official repository for the VDSemiX Interactive Logo. This project is a high-tech, futuristic 3D digital identity designed for the Vinod Dham Centre of Excellence for Semiconductors and Microelectronics at Delhi Technological University (DTU).

💡 The Vision
Inspired by Shri Vinod Dham 👨‍í, the "Father of the Pentium Chip," this logo represents India's 🇮🇳 journey toward semiconductor self-reliance.

Moon 🌙: Represents deep research and the foundation of ideas.

Earth 🌍: Represents the DTU campus and the Indian Semiconductor Mission.

Sun ☀️: Represents the ultimate source of innovation and energy.

"V" Shape: Formed by the constellation of these celestial bodies, honoring Vinod Dham.

✨ Features & Effects
🖱️ 3D Parallax: The entire scene tilts and moves based on your mouse cursor.

✨ Constellation Clutter: No boring solid lines! Planets are connected by "Digital Bits" and glowing stars.

🌗 HD Realism: Uses high-definition NASA imagery for the Moon, Earth, and Sun.

🌕 Pentium Gold UI: The branding uses the iconic gold accent to honor the legacy of the Pentium processor.

🚫 Zero White Space: A deep, immersive cosmic background that looks great on any screen.

🛠️ Tech Stack
HTML5 🏗️ - Structural layout and 3D viewport.

CSS3 🎨 - Advanced 3D transforms (preserve-3d), neon glows, and space gradients.

JavaScript ⚡ - Dynamic star generation and 3D interaction logic.
